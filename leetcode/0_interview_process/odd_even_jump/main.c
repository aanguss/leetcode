// Input: [10,13,12,14,15]
// Output: 2
// Explanation: 
// From starting index i = 0, we can jump to i = 2 (since A[2] 
//     is the smallest among A[1], A[2], A[3], A[4] that is 
//     greater or equal to A[0]), then we can't jump any more.
// From starting index i = 1 and i = 2, we can jump to i = 3, 
//     then we can't jump any more.
// From starting index i = 3, we can jump to i = 4, so we've 
//     reached the end.
// From starting index i = 4, we've reached the end already.
// In total, there are 2 different starting indexes (i = 3, i = 4) 
//     where we can reach the end with some number of jumps.
