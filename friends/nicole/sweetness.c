// why programming?

// dropped into a new tool, what is your method of learning?
// does the interviewer know how to learn

// const, makes firmware code more debuggable (team function - variable shoudlnt' change)

// example of a project - priorities and how they were identified

// predefined range with array  and linked list is dynamic
// linked list you have to go through whole list and array you can access index directly

// cpu polling vs interrupt to just come in
// interrupts can do edge and level
// polling can only do level

// debug memory - apply a known pattern in question

// defrag algorithm
// hardware limitation - dont want to cut performance - dont block host traffic
// PLI - how to track before you lost power
// defrag.c
